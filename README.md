LLM call to llama-server to parse new pdf documents into meaningful database

## Python is the best for AI automation

Call llama-server to perform automatic scan of a folder `documents`: if there are new pdf files it will start to 
explore the pdf as follows"
- open a pdf
- transform it into text
- extract the summary
- extract the 5 most relevant topics
A local database in python `pickle` will contain all these information for further GUI interactions or Q&A sessions.


### Requirements
```bash
pip install requests rich langchain-text-splitters tiktoken pypdf easygui
```
Then we need
- [llama.cpp binaries (version b5686)](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases/download/b5686/llama-b5686-bin-win-cpu-x64.zip), to download and extract the ZIP file in your project directory (mine is called `localFolderSCAN`)
- [Qwen2.5-1.5B-instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q6_k.gguf?download=true): a good small LLM with great context window and amazing performance. Download it in the same project folder.
- a PDF document as example: download it in the same directory (from this repo, called AIgentsFail.pdf)

### Run the llama.cpp server
First thing, letâ€™s make sure our LocalGPT engine is running. Open one terminal window in the BETTER_RAG folder and execute:
```bash
llama-server.exe -m .\qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q6_k.gguf -c 8192
```
This will start the server and listen the API endpoints at  http://127.0.0.1:8080 with a context window of 8k tokens.

Run from the terminal `python test_mylib3_noStream.py` 

In the first run it will create:
- a subfolder called `documents`
- `doc_db.pkl` containing a list of dict with rich information about every pdf added to the folder
- `index.pkl` the list of pdf files to spot new entries and start the process again.

### local libs
I created 2 different local libraries
- RAGLIB.py
- mydoclib.py

The first one is used for LLM calls with json and requests
The second one handles the file operations and the Exploratory Document Analysis (EDA)
